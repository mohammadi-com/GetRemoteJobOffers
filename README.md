# GetRemoteOffers - ASAP
I created this guide out of my passion for the developer community. A star 🌟 on this repo would be greatly appreciated 🤗, as it motivates me to dedicate more time to it.

If you have any comments, ideas, or appreciation, please use the [discussions](https://github.com/mohammadi-com/JobNavigator/discussions) tab. Don't hesitate to **clone**, **fork**, and submit **pull requests**!

This guide is designed like a to-do list, so there's no need to read it all at once. In each step, I purposefully suggest only one tool to keep you from wondering what to use. Just follow each step, slaying one dragon at a time, until you land that job offer.

## Resume Prepration
I was a fan of creating my resume using my own LaTeX template, but I realized that although my resume looked professional and polished, it wasn't easily readable by machines—the very machines we humans created!

Before your resume reaches a real human, it’s often first skimmed by an Application Tracking System (ATS). Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your resume's text is readable and extractable by these systems. While I love the authenticity of a handcrafted resume, it's in your best interest to use resume builders to create your resume. Most ATS are optimized for these resume formats and can read them easily. This increases your chances of being noticed and, hopefully, invited to an interview.

[Resume.com](https://www.resume.com/) is a great, free, easy to use tool to create resume.

Notes:
- Don’t rely on ChatGPT to write your entire resume. Instead, draft it yourself and use ChatGPT as a helper. A simple prompt like, “Rewrite and keep my tone,” can refine your text while preserving authenticity, eliminating grammar or dictation errors, and often enhancing the wording.
- **Include relevant public profile** pages in your CV (like GitHub, StackOverflow, Kaggle, etc.). Only add them if they showcase your skills; empty profiles won't help and could even hurt your application. Make sure these links strengthen your application, not weaken it.
- **Check for grammar and spelling mistakes** using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/). Writing correctly is crucial as it reflects your attention to detail.
- **Ensure all links work** properly across different environments.
- **Include the location for each job.** If you have remote work experience, label it as “remote.” This is a positive signal for remote-first companies, showing you’re experienced in remote team collaboration.
- **Upload your resume to [ResumeWorded](https://resumeworded.com/)** and aim for a score of 80 or higher. The tool provides valuable feedback to improve your resume, and you can also explore their public resources for additional tips. Iterate until you’re satisfied before moving on.



## Customized Cover Letter Generation
A resume is a finely-tuned document that takes a lot of effort to perfect. This makes it challenging to customize every single time (though if you can, that's fantastic). That's where a cover letter comes in—it's your chance to build on your resume and explain why you're the ideal candidate for this specific job.

Keep your cover letter simple, concise, and straight to the point. Put yourself in the recruiter's shoes: Why should they choose you? Make yourself stand out. How? Start by carefully reading the job posting and researching the company. In your cover letter, be genuine—share which aspects of their business resonate with you and highlight the skills and expertise you bring to the table that align with the job.

I've noticed some people skip the cover letter entirely, and that's a big mistake. Leaving it blank sends the message that you're not really serious about the opportunity.

I've developed a tool that makes creating customized cover letters and tracking job applications easier—all in one place: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JLJsuzzWHczKW7iCFxVbFBNklphQIl29-j2WxLb1geQ/edit?usp=sharing

## Start Applying for Jobs

### [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
As you may know, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) is the main source for job opportunities, so start applying there. Here are some tips:

- **Complete your profile.** Consider using LinkedIn Premium for AI-assisted headlines, personalized text, and deeper insights into the job market.
- **Request recommendations** from former co-workers to strengthen your profile.
- **Use a friendly, not overly formal profile picture.** A close-up of your face is ideal—skip the full-length shot—and make sure it’s visible to others.
- **Engage with content** related to your field and publish your own to increase your visibility.
- **Pass LinkedIn assessments.** This can help LinkedIn promote you to recruiters. ![LinkedInAssessment](./Images/LinkedInAssessment.png)
- **Avoid using EasyApply.** Often, LinkedIn isn’t fully integrated with ATS software, making it harder for recruiters to see your resume. Instead, apply directly on the company's website.
- **Search for worldwide opportunities.** Include "worldwide" in your search location for remote jobs to expand your options and see more opportunities. ![WorldWide](./Images/WorldWide.png)
- **Prioritize job posts with under 10 applicants.** With less competition, you have a better chance of landing an interview. However, this doesn’t mean you should ignore other job postings—apply broadly, but focus on those with fewer applicants first. ![Under10](./Images/Under10.png) 
- **Obviously, turn on the remote option** in your job search filters.
![RemoteFilter](./Images/RemoteFilter.png)

Absolutely, LinkedIn is a powerhouse for job hunting, but don't sleep on other platforms. They often have less competition, giving you a better shot at landing something great. Case in point: I found my London gig on [Cord.co](https://cord.co/).


### [Cord](https://cord.co/)
[Cord](https://cord.co/) is more UK-centric with a smaller pool of listings. You can set up an account, but don't be surprised if your resume gets rejected and you're unable to message recruiters directly on the platform. No big deal though—just head to the company's website and apply directly!


### [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/)
If you're after remote work, [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/) is a gem.


### [HoneyPot](https://www.honeypot.io/)
[HoneyPot](https://www.honeypot.io/) is a reverse-apply platform, meaning you set up your profile, and companies come to you with job opportunities. The great part is that once your profile is ready, you don't have to do much else. We also leverage HoneyPot for its resources. One standout feature is the dedicated talent advisor who can set up mock interviews for you at no cost, so you can practice before the real thing—definitely a game-changer.

They also have a [dev-community](https://cult.honeypot.io/) packed with in-depth reports, offering valuable insights into the job market if that’s something you're interested in.

One thing to note: when creating your account, you'll be asked about the types of jobs you're after. If you say you're only looking for remote roles, your account might not get activated. A better strategy is to indicate that you're open to jobs and willing to relocate, but with a preference for remote work. This is actually realistic because if an amazing relocation offer comes your way, you might just take it.


### [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm)
[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm) is primarily known for its company reviews, giving you insight into what it's like to work at different places. But don't overlook their job section—it's a solid resource where you can search for and apply to jobs as well.


### [Indeed](https://indeed.com/)
[Indeed](https://indeed.com/) is one of the largest job listing platforms out there, offering a vast range of opportunities across different industries.


### [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)
[WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) is also another source for remote jobs.


### [Wellfound (Formerly AngelList)](https://wellfound.com/)
[Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/) focuses on startup job opportunities, especially in North America. However, keep in mind that if you have more than a 2-hour time zone difference, your chances of landing an interview might decrease.


### [GolangProjects](https://www.golangprojects.com/)
[GolangProjects](https://www.golangprojects.com/) is dedicated to Go developers, making it a solid resource for Go-related job opportunities.

I'm always on the lookout for more domain and language-specific job platforms, so if you know of any, feel free to share them in the [discussions](https://github.com/mohammadi-com/JobNavigator/discussions) section.


### Cold Outreach
When you're job hunting, you might come across a position that you really love and are a great fit for. To stand out, consider searching for the company founders or hiring managers and finding their contact emails using [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co/) or other tools.

Then, take the time to write a compelling letter explaining why you’d be valuable to the company and highlight the skills that match the position. Attach your resume and send it directly to them.

This method is time-consuming, so aim to do it for about 10 jobs per month. The extra effort can set you apart from other applicants and increase your chances of getting an interview.

This approach has often led to interviews for me.

### Referrals
If you're going for a job and you know someone at the company, ask them to refer you. It could benefit your friend too, as companies often pay referral bonuses if you get hired.

Plus, it helps you by often getting you straight to the interview stage. Your friend can also help you prep for the interviews.


## Prep for Interview

First off, congrats on landing an interview! This means you've nailed the earlier steps. The goal of your CV, cover letter, and everything else was to get you here. From now until you get that job offer, those tools are no longer in play—it's all on you.

According to interviewer research, 71% of candidates get rejected for non-technical reasons, even though most think it’s about their technical skills. Check out the reasons below and make sure you avoid these common mistakes.

![Rejection Chart](./Images/RejectionChart.png)


### Show, Don’t Tell
A lot of people, when told to "show" a characteristic in an interview, end up just saying, "I am [that characteristic]." This approach is pretty ineffective. For example, if you want to prove you're a team player, don't just say it—bring up examples of times you've worked well in a team. Let your actions speak for themselves.

### STAR Method (Action Verbs)
STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. This method help you to convey your message in a structured way that helps the interviewer to understand your accomplishments better. It is like saying bullet points, so you can use this method in CV, coverletter, and interview.

An example would be like:

**Question**: "Describe a time when you had to optimize a poorly performing piece of code or system."

**Situation**

As a backend developer at an e-commerce company, I noticed that our product search functionality was significantly slowing down during peak hours.

**Task**

My task was to identify the performance issues and optimize the search functionality to improve response times.

**Action**

I analyzed the code and discovered that complex database queries were causing the slowdown. I implemented a denormalized search index using Elasticsearch, rewrote the search algorithm to utilize this index, and added caching for frequently searched terms. I also conducted thorough testing to ensure accuracy.

**Result**
These changes reduced search response times by **90%**, allowing the system to handle five times more concurrent requests. User satisfaction scores for the search feature increased by **35%**, and overall system stability improved during peak hours.

This experience taught me the importance of performance optimization and effective use of search technologies in software development.


### Improve Your English
If English isn’t your first language, consider joining free discussion courses to improve. I've heard from friends that [Oteacher](https://oteacher.org/) is a great resource. If you know of any other good ones, feel free to share. Expanding your vocabulary and learning to communicate your ideas clearly and professionally, with an understandable tone, accent, and pace, is crucial. Improving your English is an investment that pays off beyond just the job search—it’s a valuable asset for your life and career. Make it a habit to spend 3-4 hours a day working on this skill.

### Boost Your Confidence
Confidence builds over time. Remember, the interviewer is just another person, and they’re there to have a conversation with you. This is your chance to create a collaborative and friendly vibe. A great way to build confidence is by doing mock interviews.

### Practice with Mock Interviews
Practice makes perfect. Just like you’d do mock tests before a driving test, mock interviews are essential here too. Get a friend, mentor, or another resource to help you out. Some websites can also assist with this:
- HoneyPot: As mentioned earlier, you can set up free mock interviews with your talent advisor.

### Look Presentable
First impressions count. Make sure your background is clean and free of distractions. Comb your hair, wear appropriate clothing—not too formal, but not too casual either. Also, position your camera at eye level.

### Be Punctual
This might seem obvious, but a lot of candidates still miss interviews. Ensure you have a stable internet connection and log into the meeting room at least 10 minutes before the start time.

### Research the Job and Company
Surprise the interviewer with your knowledge of the company. This shows how much you care, and even if you lack some skills, your passion might give you an edge. Thoroughly read their website, understand their competition, their strengths, the business sector, future industry trends, how your role can help the company grow, and so on.


## Interview Stages

Interviews typically consist of three main stages: 1) HR Interview, 2) Technical Interview, and 3) Cultural Fit Interview. While each company may have its own specific steps, these core stages are usually the same. Let’s break down how to ace each one.

### HR Interview

One of the most common questions is "Tell me about yourself," or some variation of it. This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmFuWmzeiDs) does a great job explaining how to prepare for it.

For more in-depth prep, the [BigInterview YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Biginterview) is packed with resources and sample answers for a wide range of interview questions. You’ll likely find a relevant video for any question you might be wondering about.

### Technical Interview

Technical interviews usually focus on two main areas: 1) Data Structures and Algorithms, and 2) System Design.

For Data Structures and Algorithms, I recommend practicing with [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). If you're looking for a solid book to build your foundation, I highly suggest [Data Structures and Basics of Algorithms by Dr. Ghodsi](https://fatemi.ir/book/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%84%DA%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AA%D9%85%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7/) for Persian speakers.

For System Design, I don’t have a specific resource to recommend, but you can find numerous online courses and materials that cover the basics.

### Cultural Fit Interview

This interview is typically conducted by a senior team member, and it could even be the founder or CEO. The goal here is to determine if you're a good fit for the company culture. While companies might be flexible on technical skills, they’re usually strict about personality traits. Think carefully before answering questions in this interview.

You'll need to demonstrate traits like adaptability, enthusiasm, a positive attitude, willingness to learn, flexibility, integrity, teamwork, and innovation.

Think of it this way: if companies are looking for these qualities, it's a sign that they’re essential for success. So, it’s a smart move to develop these traits in yourself, regardless of your job search.
